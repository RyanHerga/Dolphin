This is an unnamed application being developed by the CompSci Club Organization at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona to help students in the United States to find internships and entry-level jobs in select industries.

Students will be able to create profiles, add classes they've taken, skills they're proficient in, and upload their resume + transcripts to get matched with opportunities that fits their skillsets and experience.
